# Communicating News And Decisions

Communicating new information, important decisions, or any important news within your organization requires more thought than just writing an email or setting up a meeting. People interpret the same message differently, and casual communication without preparation can lead to increased workload as you spend more time clarifying and calming individuals down. Here's a structured guide on how to effectively communicate:

1. **Avoid Group Communication Initially:**
   Never initiate communication with the entire group on the first attempt. Group communication at the outset can create a sense of opposition, positioning you against them. Even positive news may be perceived critically based on individual feedback.

2. **Start with 1o1 Conversations:**
   Initiate one-on-one discussions with trusted reports who can provide honest feedback. Engage with those who may be passionately against the information to gather diverse perspectives.

3. **Refine Based on Feedback:**
   Use the feedback obtained to refine your message. This iterative process helps tailor the communication to address concerns and nuances.

4. **Continue Individual Communications:**
   Extend this process to all individuals within the organization. Communicating one-on-one allows for continuous refinement and mitigates immediate critical reactions, preventing the spread of negativity.

5. **Act Swiftly:**
   Communicate the information quickly; don't let the message spread without your guidance. Ensure all reports hear it directly from you initially.

6. **Allow Cascade of Communication:**
   Once everyone in your organization is informed, allow individuals to relay the message to their reports and so forth.

7. **Gather Continuous Feedback:**
   Keep gathering feedback and refining your message to address emerging concerns.

8. **Official Communication to Entire Organization:**
   Send out an official communication to the entire organization once the refined message has been delivered individually.

9. **Delegate Communication Writing:**
   Consider delegating the writing of the communication to one of your reports. This not only empowers them but also signals alignment within your team.

10. **Ensure Alignment in Communication:**
    Ensure that you own or align with the decisions communicated. Simply relaying information without demonstrating alignment may erode trust.

11. **Avoid Bossy Moves:**
    Refrain from interrupting team meetings, hijacking agendas, and dumping information without engagement. Such actions can be perceived as bossy and may convey a lack of regard for others' time.

12. **Infuse Empathy:**
    Incorporate empathy into your communication by providing reasoning behind decisions and proactively addressing potential questions.

13. **Utilize Minto Pyramid Method:**
    Employ the Minto Pyramid method to structure and convey your message effectively.

Implementing these steps may seem meticulous, but it safeguards against misinformation, groupism, and negative criticism. In the context of a large number of reports, consider reorganizing sustainably to maintain effective communication.

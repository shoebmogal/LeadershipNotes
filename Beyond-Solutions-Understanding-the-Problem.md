### Beyond Solutions: Understanding the Problem

In the dynamic world of startups, the rush towards providing quick solutions often overshadows the essence of understanding the real problem. This chapter delves into the importance of a problem-first approach, advocating for a shift from being mere executors to becoming true partners in the problem-solving process.

**Embracing the Problem, Not Just the Solution**

Startups, buzzing with the zeal to innovate, frequently dive into solution mode. However, the key to impactful innovation lies in deeply understanding the problem at hand. It's not uncommon for customers to approach with predefined solutions. Yet, the role of a technical team extends beyond being an execution arm; it is to be a collaborative partner. This partnership is grounded in thoroughly comprehending the problem, evaluating if it warrants a solution, and then, if deemed necessary, devising the most effective resolution or sometimes, choosing not to solve it but with a clear rationale.

**A Framework for Deep Problem Understanding**

To facilitate a comprehensive understanding, a set of probing questions is essential. These questions span understanding the problem's nature, its impact, urgency, and the motivations behind solving it. They also extend to evaluating the potential consequences of the solution, understanding the stakeholders involved, and assessing the broader context. This framework not only uncovers the problem but also highlights potential risks and reasons that might deter from solving it, enabling an informed decision-making process.

**Practical Application: A Real-World Example**

Reflecting on my journey as a cofounder and director of engineering, I recall instances where this approach transformed challenges into opportunities. For example, by applying this problem-first methodology, we identified that a seemingly critical feature request was, in reality, a workaround for a more fundamental usability issue. Instead of adding more code, we revisited the design, enhancing the user experience and solving the root problem without additional complexity.

**Template for Problem Understanding**

To apply this approach, consider the following template:

	• What is the problem?  
	• Is this solving a pain or a pleasure? 
	• Rate the pain from 1 to 5.  
	• Rate the pleasure from 1 to 5.  
	• Does it need to be solved now?  
	• Is it big enough (10x the cost) to be worth solving? 
	• What's your motivation to solve the problem?  
	• Why hasn't it been solved before? 
	• Why are you solving the problem?  
	• Why do you think you or your team can solve the problem?  
	• What happens if we don't solve it? 
	• Is someone else trying to solve it? 
	• Who's problem is it?  
	• What do the stakeholders do to circumvent the problem?  
	• How much time do the users spend on the problem per day/week/month/year?  
	• What behavior does this problem encourage?
	• Who is asking you to solve the problem? 
	• Does the user genuinely want this problem to be solved? Or there is some other motivation.
	• What new problems are you creating for the stakeholders because you are solving this problem? 
	• What behavior is the solution changing ? 
	• What is the goal the user is looking to achieve?  
	• Is there a vision that the user is wishing to realize?  
	• What is the current end-to-end experience or journey that the user has to go through to complete the job your  idea will help with?
	• What are the systems, tools and people that the user relies on to do the job today?
	• What is the emotional state of your target user during his/her current experience?
	• What are the main pain points a user encounters today?  
	• Why is the job important for the user to do?  
	• What are the user’s contextual elements that need to be taken into consideration?
	• What does the user see in his/her context where  your idea will be used? 
	• What are the target user’s thinking and feelings in the current situation?   
	• Who are the other stakeholders connected with the user?  
	• How will the connected stakeholders benefit from your solution?
	• How will the connected stakeholders be impacted by your solution?
	• How will the connected stakeholders impact the usage of your solution?
	• Who are the other stakeholders influenced by or actively influencing the target user?
	• Could the influenced stakeholders play a role in aiding/hindering adoption of your solution?
	• Are there other stakeholders who could benefit from your idea?

**Enhancing the Approach**

To further refine this methodology, consider incorporating feedback loops from stakeholders, regularly revisiting the problem definition as the project evolves, and fostering a culture that values questioning and understanding as much as executing.

By adopting a problem-first approach, technical teams can elevate their role from solution providers to strategic partners, crafting solutions that are not just efficient but truly transformative.

# Welcome to LeadershipNotes

[Jump To Content](/LeadershipNotes/Content)


Hello everyone interested in leadership! My name is Shoeb Mogal, and I've been leading teams for over ten years. I'm a Director of Engineering and also co-founded a company. I've learned a lot through both successes and challenges.

LeadershipNotes is my blog where I share what I've learned about being a good leader. It's my personal space to reflect and offer advice, based on my own experiences. Remember, these are my views and not those of my employers.

This blog is a way for me to share knowledge, connect with others, and stay true to my leadership values. I've learned many lessons the hard way, and I'm still learning. I'm not saying my way is the only way, but it's what has worked for me.

I'll keep updating the blog with more lessons from my notes, so there's always something new to learn.

If you're an experienced leader, someone just starting, or just curious about leadership, I hope you'll find something valuable here. Thanks for checking out LeadershipNotes. Let's learn about leadership together.

Feel free to share your thoughts or get in touch with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shoebam/).

Best wishes,

Shoeb Mogal
